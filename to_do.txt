To Do:
- (Delta in random Hamiltonian does nothing. maybe change filename or so)
- (convert all normalized energies of XXZ model into absolute values)

- change plot title accordingly for different Deltas
- in the energy plots, investigate the maps that produces energies larger than the energy 
	for E_N and look at their QR decomposition.

- write 1-2 pages in theory!!!!!

Done:
- convert all normalized energies of random Hamiltonians into absolute values
- plot energies with all chis in one plot for random Hamiltonians
	- make sure to add dE in title as well
- 25.01.24
	- plot N=4 and N=5 energy as vertical lines into plot
	- N=5 as horizontal line as well.
